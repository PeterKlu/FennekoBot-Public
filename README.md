# FennekoBot

A Discord Bot programmed in JavaScript. It displays the time and date in JST in its status message and has a variety of commands. 

The bot's original purpose was to display a random image involving Fenneko from the MioFa discord server, but it's objective has slightly changed. Now the bot will rarely include quotes from other people on top of having extra commands and the aforementioned time and date display.
